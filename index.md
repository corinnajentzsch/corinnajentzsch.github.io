## Welcome!

I'm an Assistant Professor of International Relations at the Institute of Political Science at Leiden University. My research focuses on civilian collective action during civil war, and conflict transformation and escalation. I'm also broadly interested in social movements, political violence, peacekeeping, African politics, and fieldwork methods and ethics. I've conducted extensive fieldwork in southern Africa, including Mozambique, Zambia, and Malawi.

My book [_Violent Resistance: Militia Formation and Civil War in Mozambique_](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/violent-resistance/9F6785EA6663B77BAA90E8A5FDAC5323 "Violent Resistance"), published with Cambridge University Press, came out in January 2022. It has been reviewed in the ["Journal of Southern African Studies."](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03057070.2022.2083859).      

My work has also appeared in the _Journal of Conflict Resolution_, _Civil Wars_, _Africa_, _ForeignAffairs.com_, _African Conflict and Peacebuilding Review_, and several edited volumes.    

I received my PhD from Yale University, and prior to that studied at Free University Berlin and Sciences Po Paris. I'm a co-convener of the [Leiden University Center for International Relations (LUCIR)](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/lucir "LUCIR"), a member of the Editorial Review Board of the [_African Studies Review_](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/african-studies-review/ "ASR"), a contributor to [_Africa is a Country_](http://africasacountry.com/ "Africa is a Country"), and you can follow me on Twitter ([@coboje](https://twitter.com/coboje)).
